# Semantic Segmentation with the DeepGlobe Land Cover Dataset

This project is about training a convolution neural network to for sementic segmentation of satelite images. That is,
take a satelite image showing the land coverage (forest, crops, ...) and produce a mask that classifies each pixel based
on its usage.
